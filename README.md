# SIMPLE BANK
#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Simple bank is, as the name already tells you, a simple bank aplication, which allows you to make some simple bank transactions or offers you different financial info.
When you open the aplication, it greets you and offers you different options. If you don't have an account yet, you can create a new user or you can select a user from the users that are already in the bank. You can view them by selecting one of the number that the aplication provides you. Each user has its own account. By selecting the right number, the selected user can deposit the money or withdraw the money from his account. If he is interested in binding the money for specific time he can get some info about the interest he will get after the end of the saving time. The user can also get some information about the loan, more specific: how much money he will need to pay the bank each month for the repayment of the total loan.
File project.py contains all the code. I imported Enum and created class that helped me with returning !!object!! in other functions, that returns the same !!value!! so that I could return the values from different functions.
I made a list of bank users in which the new user can append himself. File project.py contains also global variable (fixed_rate) and a variable user_input with a value 7, that I used in while loop, when prompting a user for the input. I also made another global variable current_bank_account_number with value 0. The mentioned variable I then used in function creating_new_user, where the user creates a new bank user. The global variable is used to create user account number, which is incremented for every new user, so each user has different account number. 
In main function the greeting is first printed, then I implemented the while loop. First it prints all the possibilities user has in simple bank and then it prompts the user for entering the certain number (what he would like to do). We then have if-else statements to check the user input and based on the number the user enters, the implemented function runs the program. The user can select the numbers from 1 to 7, if he enter different number or a string, he gets a message that the number is not valid or that he must enter a number. When the user enter the number 7, the while loop breaks and the program exit.
In project.py I created 5 classes. A class User, to create an instance of a user, a class Account, to create an instance of user account, a class Credit, where functions about loan and saving information are nested, and two classes, which are more of a helper (class Result and class TransactionStatus (which is Enum) - that I used for returning values!!!! in other functions).
Class User has a constructor with first name, last name, address and account, that is bond with class Account. 
Class Account has a contructor with account number and account balance. Under class Account I implemented two nested functions, deposit and withdraw. They both returns !!!!! object result!!!!! If the user wants to withdraw more money than his balance is, the function returns user account balance and the transaction status(Failed). if the amount user wants to withdraw is less than his account balance, the function returns the account balance after the withdraw and the transaction status(Succeeded). 
Under class Credit I implemented five nested functions for two different information, about saving money and borrowing money. For both information I wrote a seperate code to first get info about interest, they are different for loan and for binding money. For saving money I wrote another function in which I loop through range of months (the user input for how many months he would like to bind money) and then I calculate the interest the user will received at the end of binding period. The function then returns the interest to a function that handle all saving information and is implemented on line 216. The current function also prints out the information to the user. For information about loan I wrote, besides function get_loan_interest, two more nested (under class Credit) functions. One calculates the monthly repayment, and returns the value to the function that handles loan information (handle_loan_info, that also prints out the monthly payment the user will have to pay the bank to repay the loan), while the other loops through the period of months (input of a user) and prints out for each month how much more the user has to pay to repay the loan. 
Because in the main function there are a lot of same prints for the user, I wrote several functions that holds that prints and I call this functions in main function, so the code is more readable and main function is shorter.
In file requirements.txt i wrote pytest which I used for testing the functions in a file test_project.py.
